            <p>FlyMe helps with common tasks in private aviation.
            It is intended for use by individual pilots, flying clubs, owner associations, flight schools and charter services.</p>
            <p>The feature set is tailored to private flying:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>pilot logbooks</li>
                <li>airplane logbooks</li>
                <li>compute membership and flight fees</li>
                <li>reserve airplanes</li>
                <li>works on smartphones, tablets and desktop PCs</li>
                <li>ease of use â€“ also when time is short</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This software requires a live internet connection.
                It is not intended for use in flight, but can well be used immediately thereafter:
            Complete your flight records conveniently and quickly even before you leave the cockpit.</p>
            <p>Note that this software can <em>not</em> replace the keeping of flight records on paper where this is legally required.</p>

            <h2>Implementation</h2>
            <p>This software is implemented as a web application.
                It runs in web browsers on mobile devices and desktop PCs.
            As such, end users can use it without installing any additional software.</p>
            <p>For operators, providing this application requires knowledge of <a href="https://www.python.org">Python</a> and <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com">Django</a> in order to install and deploy it on a web server.
            At this time, I develop this program for my personal use, hosting it for a couple of friends and myself.
            There is no public service yet, but I'll consider this at a later time for demo purposes.
            As such, the program is not ready for anyone but experienced Django web developers who can operate it on their own.</p>
            <p>FlyMe is open source software developed at <a href="https://github.com/carstenfuchs/flyme">GitHub</a>.
                It is licensed under the <a href="https://github.com/carstenfuchs/flyme/blob/master/LICENSE">MIT license</a>.
