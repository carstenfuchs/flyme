# FlyMe

An online logbook for private pilots and associations.

This software helps with common tasks in private aviation.
It is intended for use by individual pilots, flying clubs, owner associations, flight schools and charter services.

The feature set is tailored to private flying:

  - pilot logbooks
  - airplane logbooks
  - compute membership and flight fees
  - works on smartphones, tablets and desktop PCs
  - ease of use â€“ also when time is short

This software requires a live internet connection.
It is not intended for use in flight, but can very well be used immediatly thereafter:
Even before you leave the cockpit, you can complete your flight records conveniently and quickly.

Note that this software can *not* replace the keeping of flight records on paper where this is legally required.


## Implementation

This software is implemented as a web application. It runs in web browsers on mobile devices and desktop PCs. As such, end users can use it without installing any additional software.

For operators, providing this application requires knowledge of [Python](https://www.python.org) and [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com) in order to install and deploy it on a web server.

At this time, I develop this program for my personal use, providing it to a couple of friends and myself. It is not ready for anyone but experienced Django web developers who can use it on their own. It is licensed under the MIT license. Contributions are welcome!
